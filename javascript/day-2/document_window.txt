1. Write the block on the difference between document and window objects

Window Objects:
-----------------------
The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM).

The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object. Properties related to window objects 
are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.

Syntex: window.propertyname;


Document Objects:
-------------------
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.

After the window gets loaded then thereâ€™s a document (HTML, PHP, or another document) loaded inside that window, 
and the properties related to that document is stored in the document object. Properties related to document objects are title, URL, cookie, etc.

Syntex: document.propertyname;

Difference:
-------------------
Document:

  -> It represents the document loaded inside the window or browser.
  -> The properties related to it are stored in the document object.
  -> It is loaded after the loading window because the window contains a document.
  -> It is the root element of the document object model.
  -> It is an object of window.
  -> We can not access windows objects properties inside the document.

Window:
 
  -> It represents the browser window in which you are seeing the content.
  -> The properties related to it are stored in the window object.
  -> It is loaded before the document because window container document.
  -> The window is the global element for all objects, functions, etc.
  -> It is an object of the browser.
  -> We can access document object properties inside the window.
