Javascript Day-1
-----------------------------------

1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Indroduction of HTTP: 
---------------------
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for exchanging information over the internet. HTTP is like the delivery system for information on the internet. 
It makes sure information goes from one place to another, like how ships carry goods across the ocean. It's the foundation of the World Wide Web.

Difference of HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2: 
-------------------------------

  * The first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. It's created on 1997

  * In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP2 was created.

  * HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1.

  * HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

  * HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

  * In HTTP1.1 each request had to wait for a response before the next request Could be sent.

  * HTTP2 uses multiplexing to allow multiple concurrent requests and responses over a single TCP Connection.

  * HTTP1.1 relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow, so each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism. 

  * The major feature differentiates HTTP2 from HTTP1.1 is the binary framing layer. Unlike HTTP1.1, HTTP2 uses a binary framing layer


2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or 
functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :
--------------------------------------------------

    let school = {
    name : “Vivekananda School”,
    location : “Delhi”,
    established : “1971”
    }

In the above example “name”, “location”, “established” are all “keys” and “Vivekananda School”, “Delhi” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively.

Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object

3. Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address?

IP Address:
-----------
Protocol (IP) address is a unique numerical identifier for every device or network that connects to the internet. Typically assigned by an internet service provider (ISP), 
an IP address is an online device address used for communicating across the internet.

There are two versions of IP addresses that are commonly used on the internet: IPv4 and IPv6. An IPv4 address is expressed as a set of four dotted decimal numbers, where each octet is separated by a period, such as 192.168.35.4.
The three digits in the first octet represent a particular network on the internet while the rest of the digits represent the actual host address within the local network, such as a workstation or a server. 
An IPv6 address represents eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, such as 2620:cc:8000:1c82:544c:cc2e:f2fa:5a9b. 

Port:
-----

A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system. Each port is associated with a specific process or service.
Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages, for instance, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection.

HTTP methods:
-------------

GET: The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

HEAD: Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.

POST: A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

DELETE: Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

CONNECT: Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

OPTIONS: Describes the communication options for the target resource.

TRACE: Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

MAC address:
------------

    * MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. 
    It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet.
    * It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).
    * It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.
    * It is 12-digit, and 48 bits long, out of which the first 24 bits are used for OUI(Organization Unique Identifier), and 24 bits are for NIC/vendor-specific.
    * It works on the data link layer of the OSI model.
    * It is provided by the device's vendor at the time of manufacturing and embedded in its NIC, which is ideally cannot be changed.
    * The ARP protocol is used to associate a logical address with a physical or MAC address.
