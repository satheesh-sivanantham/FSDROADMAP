Difference between window, screen and document in JavaScript?

1. Window: The window object represents the browser window that contains the document. It is the global object in client-side JavaScript, and it represents the entire browser window.
Anything you define globally in JavaScript (variables, functions, etc.) becomes a property or method of the window object. For example, you can use window.alert() to display an alert 
box, or simply alert() because window is the global object.

2. Screen: The screen object represents the properties of the user's screen, such as width, height, color depth, etc. It is not as commonly used as the window or document objects, 
but it can be helpful for determining the dimensions or characteristics of the user's screen.

3. Document: The document object represents the HTML document that is currently displayed in the browser window. It provides methods and properties to manipulate the content of the 
document, such as adding or removing elements, changing styles, or handling events. The document object is part of the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a hierarchical 
representation of the HTML structure of a web page.
